= Summary =
There is a new *Beta version* of VLC-Record for Ubuntu 10.4 x86. This beta includes libVLC of vlc media player 1.14! 

== Requirements ==
You need Qt installed (libqt4-dev, libqt4-sql-sqlite2). Also you need the vlc installed which is shipped with Ubuntu. This package will not be used, but makes sure you have installed needed libraries. I might miss something which should also be installed ... I can't check it here.

== Installation ==
You *MUST* extract the archive to _/opt/vlc-record_. It will not work, if you use another path! To extract the package, type in following command line:

{{{
cd /
sudo tar -xvjpf /path/to/vlc-record_2.xxBETA_ubuntu_10_4_x86.tar.bz2
}}}

== Start the program ==
The binary is located in _/opt/vlc-record/bin_. So if you want to start it, create a shortcut with following command line:

{{{
/opt/vlc-record/bin/vlc-record
}}}

... or type in this command line in your terminal.

== Known Limitations ===
 * There are problems with the shortcuts. I have no idea how to fix it. After pressing some key combinations often, shortcuts will not work until you restart VLC-Record.
 * When changing aspect ratio, video frame is sometimes not shrinked / positioned as needed.
 * Programm might freeze when you close it the first time.
