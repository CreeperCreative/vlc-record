#summary quick'n'dirty: Get VLC-Record 2.xx to work on Ubuntu 9.10
#labels Deprecated

= Intro =
Running VLC-Record 2.xx under Ubuntu isn't that easy as I liked it to ...
But because for me it's really important to have a "full" Linux-Version, I tried to figure out how to make it. Don't expect a 100% clean way. I haven't the time to do so ...

= What we need ... =
 * We need a "special" vlc package with last stable version of the vlc player.
 * We need the package of VLC-Record.
 * We need a (very) little knowledge about Ubuntu.

= Let's go =
 * Uninstall the old vlc as well as dependent packages.
{{{
sudo apt-get remove vlc libvlc2 libvlccore2 vlcdata
}}}

 * Download and install the new vlc package
{{{
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/vlc-1.0.5-1_i386.deb
}}}

 * tell ld where to look for libvlc
{{{
sudo sh -c "cat >/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libvlc.conf << EOF
# where to look for libvlc ...
/opt/vlc-1.0.5/lib
EOF"
}}}

 * run ldconfig
{{{
sudo ldconfig -n /opt/vlc-1.0.5/lib
}}}

 * Install VLC-Record
 * Done!
