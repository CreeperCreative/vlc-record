#summary quick'n'dirty: Get VLC-Record 2.xx to work on Ubuntu 9.10
#labels Deprecated

= Intro =
Running VLC-Record 2.xx under Ubuntu isn't that easy as I liked it to ...
But because for me it's really important to have a "full" Linux-Version, I tried to figure out how to make it. Don't expect a 100% clean way. I haven't the time to do so ...

= What we need ... =
 * We need a "special" vlc package with last stable version of the vlc player.
 * We need the package of VLC-Record.
 * We need a (very) little knowledge about Ubuntu.

= Let's go =
 * Uninstall the old vlc as well as dependent packages.
 _sudo apt-get remove vlc libvlc2 libvlccore2 vlcdata_
 * Download and install the new vlc package
 _sudo dpkg -i /path/to/vlc-1.0.5-1_i386.deb_
 * tell ld where to look for libvlc
 _sudo sh -c "cat >/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libvlc.conf << EOF"_<br />
 _# where to look for libvlc ..._<br />
 _/opt/vlc-1.0.5/lib_<br />
 _EOF_
