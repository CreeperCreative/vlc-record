#summary A (very) short and quick howto to build vlc player from souces on Ubuntu

= Introduction =

Although vlc is part of the Ubuntu distros it maybe helpful to build the player at your own because often feature updates will not be taken into the distrebution.

There is already a good [http://wiki.videolan.org/UnixCompile wiki] which descripes the build process. I have taken this as source to make it more clear for Ubuntu users.

= Get the sources =

 * [http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/1.0.5/vlc-1.0.5.tar.bz2 vlc 1.0.5]
 * [http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz LIVE555 Streaming Media library]

= Get dependencies =

{{{
sudo apt-get build-dep vlc
}}}

= Prepare =

Create a source folder and extract the live555 media stuff.
{{{
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
tar -xvzpf /path/to/live555-latest.tar.gz
}}}

Change the config input of the live media stuff to build position independent code (PIC).
Open file _~/src/live/config.linux_ and add option *-fPIC* to COMPILE_OPTS line. After that it should look like this:

{{{
COMPILE_OPTS =          $(INCLUDES) -fPIC -I. -O2 -DSOCKLEN_T=socklen_t -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE=1 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
}}}
