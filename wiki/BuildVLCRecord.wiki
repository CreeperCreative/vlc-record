#summary howto build vlc-record on Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

= Introduction =
Since Linux is such a wide field it's impossible to provide you with all possible packages so that you find the version that you need. So what we can do? Of course - make it on your own ;-)

= What do we need? =
At least we need subversion, a compiler (gcc with g++), the qt4 dev framework, make and in addition checkinstall. To get these things on Ubuntu we run:

{{{
sudo apt-get install make g++ libqt4-dev checkinstall subversion
}}}

This also will install some additional packages our packages depend on. 

= Prepare =
Create a directory where we'll put the sources of vlc-record. We could make it that way:
{{{
mkdir -p ~/src/vlc-record
}}}

Now we go into the created _src_ folder and check out the vlc-record sources.

{{{
cd ~/src
svn checkout http://vlc-record.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vlc-record vlc-record
}}}

Now it's time to have a look at vlc-records project file. If we have made our own build of the vlc player to get a working libVLC we *must* also change the project file of vlc-record because we'd like to link against the new created libVLC and we want to use only that library. Keep cool, if you know how you can write an e-Mail, you'll get this project stuff done. You need to know where you have installed the vlc player. So in case you installed it into _/opt/vlc-1.0.5_ you have to remember that path. If you used my compiled version of the vlc player it's also that path.<br />
Open the project file (vlc-record.pro) with the editor you like. Find following lines:

{{{
    FORMS += forms/cplayer.ui \
        forms/recorder_inc.ui
    SOURCES += cplayer.cpp
    LIBS += -lvlc
    win32:LIBS += -Llib
}}}

You now have to insert the path to vlc player so the linker will find the library we want to use. So change these line in that way:

{{{
    FORMS += forms/cplayer.ui \
        forms/recorder_inc.ui
    SOURCES += cplayer.cpp
    LIBS += -lvlc
    win32:LIBS += -Llib
    unix:LIBS += -L/path/to/vlc/lib \
        -Wl,-rpath /path/to/vlc/lib
}}}

So if - as in our case - the player is installed into _/opt/vlc-1.0.5_ these lines should look like:

{{{
    FORMS += forms/cplayer.ui \
        forms/recorder_inc.ui
    SOURCES += cplayer.cpp
    LIBS += -lvlc
    win32:LIBS += -Llib
    unix:LIBS += -L/opt/vlc-1.0.5/lib \
        -Wl,-rpath /opt/vlc-1.0.5/lib
}}}
